				<p>In this module, we will learn the fundamentals of web design and client-side scripting using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Create visually appealing and interactive websites.</p>
				<p>This module is fully online. Each week consists of a recap of the previous week, a lesson which consists of videos and coding examples, as well as practical challenges to extend your skills. Each week will culminate in a 'lab'.
				The lab will consist of longer-form code challenges that must be uploaded back to Moodle for review. In this module, 50% of your marks will come from the weekly uploads of these Labs, and they must be uploaded before the next class to receive marks.
				It is really important that you ask questions. Each week has a question forum located on Teams. Use this forum to ask questions; queries will be replied to asap, so make sure to post as much detail as you can, including screenshots of code, etc. Feel free to try and answer each other's questions as well.</p>
